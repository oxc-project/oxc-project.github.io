# What is the Oxc Project?

The JavaScript Oxidation Compiler Project is a collection of high-performance tools for the JavaScript language written in Rust.

We are building JavaScript compiler tools such as parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier and resolver.

We are also supporting new JavaScript tools such as Rspack, Rolldown and Ezno.

Our goal is to create and empower tooling for [The Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age).

## Philosophy

This project shares the same philosophies as [Biome][biome] and [Ruff][ruff].

1. JavaScript tooling could be rewritten in a more performant language.
2. An integrated toolchain can tap into efficiencies that are not available to a disparate set of tools.

> For…reasons I am experimenting w various Rust-based JS compilers. I don’t agree w every design decision but overall oxc is really well done.
