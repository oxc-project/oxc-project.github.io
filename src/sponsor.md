# 🌟 Become an Oxc Sponsor

## 🤝 How to Sponsor

You can sponsor through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Boshen) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/oxc).

## 💚 Why sponsor?

Sponsorship helps us keep improving the JavaScript and Rust ecosystems while preventing burnout from maintaining fast and evolving tools in our personal time.

If our work has improved your development experience, your CI pipelines, your build times, or your learning in any way, please consider sponsoring. It helps more than you might think, and it truly keeps the motivation alive.
