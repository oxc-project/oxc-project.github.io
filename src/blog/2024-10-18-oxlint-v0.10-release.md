Oxlint v0.10.0 is here! This release includes several exciting features,
including many improvements to configuration files.

## New Features

<!-- todo: other features -->
### New Rules

In this release, 

### Enable/Disable Rules by Category

You can now enable or disable entire categories of rules with the `categories`
field inside of your configuration file.

Now, instead of running this command:

```sh
oxlint -D correctness -W suspicious -c oxlint.json
```

You can add a `categories` field to your `oxlint.json`:

::: code-group

```jsonc [oxlintrc.json]
{
  "categories": {          // [!code ++]
    "correctness": "deny", // [!code ++]
    "suspicious": "warn",  // [!code ++]
  },                       // [!code ++]
  "rules": {
    "no-const-assign": "error",
    "import/no-cycle": "error",
  },
}
```

:::

and drop the `-D` and `-W` flags.

### `plugins` Are Now Supported in Configuration Files

Configuration files now support the `plugins` array from ESLint v8 configs.
This allows you to enable plugins without CLI arguments, making it possible to
use plugins in VSCode.

::: code-group

```jsonc [oxlintrc.json]
{
  "plugins": ["import"], // [!code ++]
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "deny",
    "suspicious": "warn",
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-uses-react": "off",
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
  },
}
```

:::

This plays nicely with `categories`, as enabled/disabled categories affect plugins as well.

::: code-group

```jsonc [oxlintrc.json]
{
  "plugins": ["import"],
  // `categories` affects all enabled plugins
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "allow",
    "suspicious": "warn",
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-const-assign": "error",
    "import/no-cycle": "error",
  },
}
```

## Breaking Changes and Migration Guide

### CLI vs Config File Rule Priority

Before, config files would override rules set in CLI arguments. For example, running this command:

```sh
oxlint -A correctness -c oxlintrc.json
```

With this config file

::: code-group

```jsonc [oxlintrc.json]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-const-assign": "error",
  },
}
```

:::

Would result in a single rule, `no-const-assign` being turned on at an error level with all other rules disabled (i.e. set to "allow").

Now, **CLI arguments will override config files**. That same command with the
same config file will result with **all rules being disabled**. To get the same
behavior as before, enable and disable categories in your config file instead of
with CLI arguments.

```sh
oxlint -c oxlint.json
```

::: code-group

```jsonc [oxlintrc.json]
{
  "categories": {           // [!code ++]
    "correctness": "allow", // [!code ++]
  },                        // [!code ++]
  "rules": {
    "no-const-assign": "error",
  },
}
```
