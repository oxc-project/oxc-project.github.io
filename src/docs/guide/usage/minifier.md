## Assumptions

To allow better optimizations, Oxc minifier makes some assumptions about your code. See [Assumptions document](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/main/crates/oxc_minifier/docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md) for more information.

## Installation

### With Rolldown

If you are using [Rolldown][url-rolldown], `oxc-minify` will be used for minification by default. No extra installation is required.

### Node.js
