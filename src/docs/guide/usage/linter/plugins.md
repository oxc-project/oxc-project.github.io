# Plugins

Oxlint supports several of the most popular ESLint plugins out of the box with
most rules in `recommended` configs already implemented.

:::warning
Oxlint does not support custom plugins at this time. We have plans to implement
this in the future. You can track its status on [our
backlog](https://github.com/oxc-project/backlog/issues/40).
:::

## Enabling Plugins

You can enable plugins using the `--<plugin-name>-plugin` CLI flag. For example,
to enable `eslint-plugin-import`, run

```sh
oxlint --import-plugin
```

Once enabled, rules in categories you have enabled will automatically be turned
on. For example,

```sh
oxlint --import-plugin -W correctness -W suspicious
```

Will enable all `correctness` and `suspicious` rules in the `import` plugin, as
well as the base rule set. Note that `correctness` rules are turned on by
default.

## Disabling Plugins

Several plugins are enabled by default, and are listed below. You can disable
them with the `--no-<plugin-name>-plugin` flag. For example, to disable
`eslint-plugin-unicorn`, run:

```sh
oxlint --no-unicorn-plugin
```

run `oxlint --help` to see a full list of flags to enable or disable plugins.

## Adding New Plugins

Do you have a favorite ESLint plugin that you'd like to see supported in Oxlint?
Please open [a feature
request](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/new?assignees=&labels=C-enhancement%2CA-linter&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=linter:%20support%20my%20favorite%20plugin).
Please be aware that we have no plans on supporting rules in plugins that require special
parsers, such as `eslint-plugin-vue` and `eslint-plugin-svelte`, though we are
open to supporting rules in these plugins that only affect script tags in their
source files.
