### What it does

Ensure that each time a `then()` is applied to a promise, a `catch()`
must be applied as well. Exceptions are made for promises returned from
a function.

### Why is this bad?

Not catching errors in a promise can cause hard to debug problems or
missing handling of error conditions. In the worst case, unhandled
promise rejections can cause your application to crash.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
myPromise.then(doSomething);
myPromise.then(doSomething, catchErrors); // catch() may be a little better
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
myPromise.then(doSomething).catch(errors);
function doSomethingElse() {
  return myPromise.then(doSomething);
}
```
