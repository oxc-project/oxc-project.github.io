### What it does

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
Object = null;
```

## Configuration

This rule accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

### exceptions

type: `string[]`

default: `[]`

List of global variable names to exclude from this rule.
Globals listed here can be assigned to without triggering warnings.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-global-assign": "error"
  }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-global-assign
```
