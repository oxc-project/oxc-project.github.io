# eslint/no-global-assign <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow modifications to read-only global variables.

### Why is this bad?

In almost all cases, you don’t want to assign a value to these global variables as doing so could result in losing access to important functionality.

### Example

```javascript
Object = null;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-global-assign
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-global-assign": "error"
  }
}
```
