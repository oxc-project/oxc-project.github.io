# eslint/no-setter-return <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>

### What it does

Setters cannot return values.

This rule can be disabled for TypeScript code, as the TypeScript compiler
enforces this check.

### Why is this bad?

While returning a value from a setter does not produce an error, the returned value is
being ignored. Therefore, returning a value from a setter is either unnecessary or a
possible error, since the returned value cannot be used.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
class URL {
  set origin() {
    return true;
  }
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
    "rules": {
        "no-setter-return": "error"
    }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-setter-return
```
