# eslint/no-empty-character-class

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow empty character classes in regular expressions

### Why is this bad?

Because empty character classes in regular expressions do not match anything, they might be typing mistakes.

### Example

```javascript
var foo = /^abc[]/;
```
