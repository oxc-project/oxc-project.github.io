<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.

### What it does

Disallow empty character classes in regular expressions

### Why is this bad?

Because empty character classes in regular expressions do not match anything, they might be typing mistakes.

### Example

```javascript
var foo = /^abc[]/;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-empty-character-class
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-empty-character-class": "error"
  }
}
```
