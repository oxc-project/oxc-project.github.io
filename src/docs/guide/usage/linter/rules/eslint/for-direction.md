### What it does

Disallow `for` loop update causing the counter to move in the wrong direction.

### Why is this bad?

A `for` loop with a stop condition that can never be reached, such as one
with a counter that moves in the wrong direction, will run infinitely.
While there are occasions when an infinite loop is intended, the
convention is to construct such loops as `while` loops. More typically, an
infinite `for` loop is a bug.

This rule forbids `for` loops where the counter variable changes in such a
way that the stop condition will never be met. For example, if the
counter variable is increasing (i.e. `i++`) and the stop condition tests
that the counter is greater than zero (`i >= 0`) then the loop will never
exit.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i--) {}

for (var i = 10; i >= 0; i++) {}

for (var i = 0; i > 10; i++) {}

for (var i = 0; 10 > i; i--) {}

const n = -2;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += n) {}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

for (var i = 0; 10 > i; i++) {
  // with counter "i" on the right
}

for (let i = 10; i >= 0; i += this.step) {
  // direction unknown
}

for (let i = MIN; i <= MAX; i -= 0) {
  // not increasing or decreasing
}
```
