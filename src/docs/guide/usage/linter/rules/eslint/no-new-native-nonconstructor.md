# eslint/no-new-native-nonconstructor <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

### What it does

Disallow `new` operators with global non-constructor functions (`Symbol`, `BigInt`)

### Why is this bad?

Both `new Symbol` and `new BigInt` throw a type error because they are
functions and not classes. It is easy to make this mistake by assuming
the uppercase letters indicate classes.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
// throws a TypeError
let foo = new Symbol("foo");

// throws a TypeError
let result = new BigInt(9007199254740991);
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
let foo = Symbol("foo");

let result = BigInt(9007199254740991);
```
