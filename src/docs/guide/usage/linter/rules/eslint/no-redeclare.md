# eslint/no-redeclare <Badge type="info" text="Pedantic" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow variable redeclaration

### Why is this bad?

n JavaScript, itâ€™s possible to redeclare the same variable name using var. This can lead to confusion as to where the variable is actually declared and initialized.

### Example

```javascript
var a = 3;
var a = 10;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-redeclare
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-redeclare": "error"
  }
}
```
