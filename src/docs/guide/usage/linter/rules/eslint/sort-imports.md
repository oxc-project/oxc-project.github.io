# eslint/sort-imports <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="fix" type="info">
<span class="emoji">üõ†Ô∏è</span> An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

This rule checks all import declarations and verifies that all imports are first sorted
by the used member syntax and then alphabetically by the first member or alias name.

When declaring multiple imports, a sorted list of import declarations make it easier for developers to read
the code and find necessary imports later.

### Why is this bad?

### Example

```javascript
import { b, a, c } from "foo.js";

import d from "foo.js";
import e from "bar.js";
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny sort-imports
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "sort-imports": "error"
  }
}
```
