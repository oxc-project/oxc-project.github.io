### What it does

When declaring multiple properties, sorting property names alphabetically makes it easier
to find and/or diff necessary properties at a later time.

### Why is this bad?

Unsorted property keys can make the code harder to read and maintain.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
let myObj = {
  c: 1,
  a: 2,
};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
let myObj = {
  a: 2,
  c: 1,
};
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny sort-keys
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "sort-keys": "error"
  }
}
```
