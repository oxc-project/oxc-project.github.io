### What it does

Disallow using an async function as a Promise executor

### Why is this bad?

The `new Promise` constructor accepts an executor function as an argument,
which has `resolve` and `reject` parameters that can be used to control the state of the created Promise.
For example:

### Example

```javascript
const result = new Promise(function executor(resolve, reject) {
  readFile("foo.txt", function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
      reject(err);
    } else {
      resolve(result);
    }
  });
});
```

The executor function can also be an `async function`. However, this is usually a mistake, for a few reasons:

- If an async executor function throws an error, the error will be lost and won’t cause the newly-constructed `Promise` to reject.This could make it difficult to debug and handle some errors.
- If a Promise executor function is using `await`, this is usually a sign that it is not actually necessary to use the `new Promise` constructor, or the scope of the `new Promise` constructor can be reduced.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-async-promise-executor
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-async-promise-executor": "error"
  }
}
```
