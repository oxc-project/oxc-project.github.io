### What it does

Disallow calling some global objects as functions

### Why is this bad?

Some global objects are not intended to be called as functions.
Calling them as functions will usually result in a TypeError being thrown.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
let math = Math();
let newMath = new Math();

let json = JSON();
let newJson = new JSON();

let atomics = Atomics();
let newAtomics = new Atomics();

let intl = Intl();
let newIntl = new Intl();

let reflect = Reflect();
let newReflect = new Reflect();

// Good
let area = (r) => 2 * Math.PI * r * r;
let object = JSON.parse("{}");
let first = Atomics.load(sharedArray, 0);
let segmenterFrom = Intl.Segmenter("fr", { granularity: "word" });
```
