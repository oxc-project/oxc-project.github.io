### What it does

Disallow comparing against -0

### Why is this bad?

The rule should warn against code that tries to compare against -0,
since that will not work as intended. That is, code like x === -0 will
pass for both +0 and -0. The author probably intended Object.is(x, -0).

### Example

```javascript
if (x === -0) {
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny /no-compare-neg-zero
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "/no-compare-neg-zero": "error"
  }
}
```
