### What it does

Disallow duplicate module imports.

### Why is this bad?

Using a single import statement per module will make the code clearer because you can see
everything being imported from that module on one line.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

In the following example the module import on line 1 is repeated on line 3. These can be
combined to make the list of imports more succinct.

```js
import something from "another-module";
import { merge } from "module";
import { find } from "module";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
import something from "another-module";
import { find, merge } from "module";
```

### Options

#### includeExports

`{ "includeExports": boolean }`

When `true` this rule will also look at exports to see if there is both a re-export of a
module as in `export ... from 'module'` and also a standard import statement for the same
module. This would count as a rule violation because there are in a sense two statements
importing from the same module.

Examples of **incorrect** when this rule is set to `true`

```js
import { merge } from "module";

export { find } from "module"; // re-export which is an import and an export.
```

Examples of **correct** when this rule is set to `true`

If re-exporting from an imported module, you should add the imports to the
`import` statement, and export that directly, not use `export ... from`.

```js
import { merge } from "lodash-es";
export { merge as lodashMerge };
```

```js
import { find, merge } from "module";

// cannot be merged with the above import
export * as something from "module";

// cannot be written differently
export * from "module";
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-duplicate-imports
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-duplicate-imports": "error"
  }
}
```
