# eslint/no-sparse-arrays

<div class="rule-meta">

### What it does

Disallow sparse arrays.

### Why is this bad?

The confusion around sparse arrays is enough that it’s recommended to avoid using them unless you are certain that they are useful in your code.

### Example

```javascript
var items = [, ,];
var colors = ["red", , "blue"];
```
