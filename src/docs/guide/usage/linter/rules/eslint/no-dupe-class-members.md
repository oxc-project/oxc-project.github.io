# eslint/no-dupe-class-members <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow duplicate class members

### Why is this bad?

If there are declarations of the same name in class members,
the last declaration overwrites other declarations silently. It can cause unexpected behaviors.

### Example

```javascript
class A {
  foo() {
    console.log("foo");
  }
  foo = 123;
}
let a = new A();
a.foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: a.foo is not a function
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-dupe-class-members
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-dupe-class-members": "error"
  }
}
```
