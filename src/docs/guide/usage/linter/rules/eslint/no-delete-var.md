### What it does

The purpose of the `delete` operator is to remove a property from an
object.

### Why is this bad?

Using the `delete` operator on a variable might lead to unexpected
behavior.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
var x;
delete x;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-delete-var
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-delete-var": "error"
  }
}
```
