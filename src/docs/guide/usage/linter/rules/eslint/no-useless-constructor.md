🛠️ An auto-fix is available for this rule.

### What it does

Disallow unnecessary constructors

This rule flags class constructors that can be safely removed without
changing how the class works.

ES2015 provides a default class constructor if one is not specified. As
such, it is unnecessary to provide an empty constructor or one that
simply delegates into its parent class, as in the following examples:


### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
```javascript
class A {
    constructor () {
    }
}

class B extends A {
    constructor (...args) {
      super(...args);
    }
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:
```javascript
class A { }

class B {
    constructor () {
        doSomething();
    }
}

class C extends A {
    constructor() {
        super('foo');
    }
}

class D extends A {
    constructor() {
        super();
        doSomething();
    }
}
```
