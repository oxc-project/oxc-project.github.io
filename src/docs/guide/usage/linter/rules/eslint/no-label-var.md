# eslint/no-label-var <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow labels that share a name with a variable.

### Why is this bad?

This rule aims to create clearer code by disallowing the bad practice of creating a label
that shares a name with a variable that is in scope.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
var x = foo;
function bar() {
  x: for (;;) {
    break x;
  }
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
// The variable that has the same name as the label is not in scope.

function foo() {
  var q = t;
}

function bar() {
  q: for (;;) {
    break q;
  }
}
```
