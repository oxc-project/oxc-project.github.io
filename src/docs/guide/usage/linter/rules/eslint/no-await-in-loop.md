# eslint/no-await-in-loop <Badge type="info" text="Perf" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule disallows the use of `await` within loop bodies. (for, for-in, for-of, while, do-while).

### Why is this bad?

It potentially indicates that the async operations are not being effectively parallelized.
Instead, they are being run in series, which can lead to poorer performance.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
async function bad() {
  for (const user of users) {
    const userRecord = await getUserRecord(user);
  }
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
async function good() {
  await Promise.all(users.map((user) => getUserRecord(user)));
}
```
