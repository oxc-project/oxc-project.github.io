# eslint/no-new <Badge type="info" text="Suspicious" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow new operators outside of assignments or comparisons.

### Why is this bad?

Calling new without assigning or comparing it the reference is thrown away and in many
cases the constructor can be replaced with a function.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
new Person();

() => {
  new Date();
};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
var a = new Date()(() => new Date());
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-new
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-new": "error"
  }
}
```
