# eslint/no-restricted-globals <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule allows you to specify global variable names that you don't want to use in your application.

### Why is this bad?

Disallowing usage of specific global variables can be useful if you want to allow a set of global
variables by enabling an environment, but still want to disallow some of those.

For instance, early Internet Explorer versions exposed the current DOM event as a global variable
`event`, but using this variable has been considered as a bad practice for a long time. Restricting
this will make sure this variable isn't used in browser code.

### Example

If we have options:

```json
"no-restricted-globals": ["error", "event"]
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```javascript
function onClick() {
  console.log(event); // Unexpected global variable 'event'. Use local parameter instead.
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-restricted-globals
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-globals": "error"
  }
}
```
