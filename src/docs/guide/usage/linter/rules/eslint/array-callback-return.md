### What it does

Enforce return statements in callbacks of array methods

### Why is this bad?

Array has several methods for filtering, mapping, and folding.
If we forget to write return statement in a callback of those, it’s probably a mistake.
If you don’t want to use a return or don’t need the returned results,
consider using .forEach instead.

### Example

```javascript
let foo = [1, 2, 3, 4];
foo.map((a) => {
  console.log(a);
});
```
