# eslint/array-callback-return <Badge type="info" text="Pedantic" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Enforce return statements in callbacks of array methods

### Why is this bad?

Array has several methods for filtering, mapping, and folding.
If we forget to write return statement in a callback of those, it’s probably a mistake.
If you don’t want to use a return or don’t need the returned results,
consider using .forEach instead.

### Example

```javascript
let foo = [1, 2, 3, 4];
foo.map((a) => {
  console.log(a);
});
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny array-callback-return
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "array-callback-return": "error"
  }
}
```
