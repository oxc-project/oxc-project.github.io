# eslint/no-console <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="fix" type="info">
<span class="emoji">ðŸ’¡</span> A suggestion is available for this rule.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallows using the global console object.

### Why is this bad?

In JavaScript that is designed to be executed in the browser,
itâ€™s considered a best practice to avoid using methods on console.
Such messages are considered to be for debugging purposes and therefore
not suitable to ship to the client.

### Example

```javascript
console.log("here");
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-console
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "error"
  }
}
```
