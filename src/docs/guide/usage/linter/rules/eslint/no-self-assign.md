# eslint/no-self-assign <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow assignments where both sides are exactly the same

### Why is this bad?

Self assignments have no effect, so probably those are an error due to incomplete refactoring. Those indicate that what you should do is still remaining.

### Example

```javascript
foo = foo;
[bar, baz] = [bar, qiz];
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-self-assign
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-self-assign": "error"
  }
}
```
