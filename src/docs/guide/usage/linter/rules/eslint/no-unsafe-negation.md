### What it does

Disallow negating the left operand of relational operators

### Why is this bad?

Just as developers might type -a + b when they mean -(a + b) for the negative of a sum,
they might type !key in object by mistake when they almost certainly mean !(key in object)
to test that a key is not in an object. !obj instanceof Ctor is similar.

### Example

```javascript
if ((!key) in object) {
  //operator precedence makes it equivalent to (!key) in object
  //and type conversion makes it equivalent to (key ? "false" : "true") in object
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny /no-unsafe-negation
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "/no-unsafe-negation": "error"
  }
}
```
