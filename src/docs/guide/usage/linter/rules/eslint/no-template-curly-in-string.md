# eslint/no-template-curly-in-string

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow template literal placeholder syntax in regular strings

### Why is this bad?

ECMAScript 6 allows programmers to create strings containing variable or expressions using template literals, instead of string concatenation, by writing expressions like ${variable} between two backtick quotes (`). It can be easy to use the wrong quotes when wanting to use template literals, by writing "${variable}", and end up with the literal value "${variable}" instead of a string containing the value of the injected expressions.

### Example

```javascript
/*eslint no-template-curly-in-string: "error"*/
"Hello ${name}!";
"Hello ${name}!";
"Time: ${12 * 60 * 60 * 1000}";
```
