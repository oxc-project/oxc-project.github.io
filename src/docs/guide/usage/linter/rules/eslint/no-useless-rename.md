### What it does

Disallow renaming import, export, and destructured assignments to the same name.

### Why is this bad?

It is unnecessary to rename a variable to the same name.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
import { foo as foo } from "foo";
const { bar: bar } = obj;
export { baz as baz };
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
import { foo } from "foo";
const { bar: renamed } = obj;
export { baz };
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-useless-rename
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-useless-rename": "error"
  }
}
```
