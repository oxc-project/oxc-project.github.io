### What it does

Disallows variable declarations, imports, or type declarations that are
not used in code.

### Why is this bad?

Variables that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most
likely an error due to incomplete refactoring. Such variables take up
space in the code and can lead to confusion by readers.

```ts
// `b` is unused; this indicates a bug.
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a;
}
console.log(add(1, 2));
```

A variable `foo` is considered to be used if any of the following are
true:

- It is called (`foo()`) or constructed (`new foo()`)
- It is read (`var bar = foo`)
- It is passed into a function or constructor as an argument (`doSomething(foo)`)
- It is read inside of a function that is passed to another function
  (`doSomething(function() { foo(); })`)
- It is exported (`export const foo = 42`)
- It is used as an operand to TypeScript's `typeof` operator (`const bar:
  typeof foo = 4`)

A variable is _not_ considered to be used if it is only ever declared
(`var foo = 5`) or assigned to (`foo = 7`).

#### Types

This rule has full support for TypeScript types, interfaces, enums, and
namespaces.

A type or interface `Foo` is considered to be used if it is used in any
of the following ways:

- It is used in the definition of another type or interface.
- It is used as a type annotation or as part of a function signature.
- It is used in a cast or `satisfies` expression.

A type or interface is _not_ considered to be used if it is only ever
used in its own definition, e.g. `type Foo = Array<Foo>`.

Enums and namespaces are treated the same as variables, classes,
functions, etc.

#### Ignored Files

This rule ignores `.d.ts` files and `.vue` files entirely. Variables,
classes, interfaces, and types declared in `.d.ts` files are generally
used by other files, which are not checked by Oxlint. Since Oxlint does
not support parsing Vue templates, this rule cannot tell if a variable
is used or unused in a Vue file.

#### Exported

The original ESLint rule recognizes `/* exported variableName */`
comments as a way to indicate that a variable is used in another script
and should not be considered unused. Since ES modules are now a TC39
standard, Oxlint does not support this feature.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: "error"*/
/*global some_unused_var*/

// It checks variables you have defined as global
some_unused_var = 42;

var x;

// Write-only variables are not considered as used.
var y = 10;
y = 5;

// A read for a modification of itself is not considered as used.
var z = 0;
z = z + 1;

// By default, unused arguments cause warnings.
(function(foo) {
  return 5;
})();

// Unused recursive functions also cause warnings.
function fact(n) {
  if (n < 2) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1);
}

// When a function definition destructures an array, unused entries from
// the array also cause warnings.
function getY([x, y]) {
  return y;
}
```

```ts
type A = Array<A>;

enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-unused-vars: "error"*/

var x = 10;
alert(x);

// foo is considered used here
myFunc(function foo() {
  // ...
}.bind(this));

(function(foo) {
  return foo;
})();

var myFunc;
myFunc = setTimeout(function() {
  // myFunc is considered used
  myFunc();
}, 50);

// Only the second argument from the destructured array is used.
function getY([, y]) {
  return y;
}
```

```ts
export const x = 1;
const y = 1;
export { y };

type A = Record<string, unknown>;
type B<T> = T extends Record<infer K, any> ? K : never;
const x = "foo" as B<A>;
console.log(x);
```

Examples of **incorrect** code for `/* exported variableName */` operation:

```js
/* exported global_var */

// Not respected, use ES modules instead.
var global_var = 42;
```

## Configuration

This rule accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

### args

Controls how unused arguments are checked.

This option has three settings:

1. `after-used` - Unused positional arguments that occur before the last
   used argument will not be checked, but all named arguments and all
   positional arguments after the last used argument will be checked.
   This is the default setting.
2. `all` - All named arguments must be used.
3. `none` - Do not check arguments.

### caughtErrors

type: `boolean`

Used for `catch` block validation.

It has two settings:

- `none` - do not check error objects. This is the default setting.
- `all` - all named arguments must be used`.`none`corresponds to`false`, while`all`corresponds to`true`.

### ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock

type: `boolean`

The `ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock` option is a boolean (default:
`false`). Static initialization blocks allow you to initialize static
variables and execute code during the evaluation of a class definition,
meaning the static block code is executed without creating a new
instance of the class. When set to true, this option ignores classes
containing static initialization blocks.

#### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for the `{ "ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock": true }` option

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock": true }]*/

class Foo {
  static myProperty = "some string";
  static mymethod() {
    return "some string";
  }
}

class Bar {
  static {
    let baz; // unused variable
  }
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock": true }` option

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "ignoreClassWithStaticInitBlock": true }]*/

class Foo {
  static {
    let bar = "some string";

    console.log(bar);
  }
}
```

### ignoreRestSiblings

type: `boolean`

Using a Rest property it is possible to "omit" properties from an
object, but by default the sibling properties are marked as "unused".
With this option enabled the rest property's siblings are ignored.

By default this option is `false`.

#### Example

Examples of **correct** code when this option is set to `true`:

```js
// 'foo' and 'bar' were ignored because they have a rest property sibling.
var { foo, ...coords } = data;

var bar;
({ bar, ...coords } = data);
```

### ignoreUsingDeclarations

type: `boolean`

The `ignoreUsingDeclarations` option is a boolean (default: `false`).
When set to `true`, the rule will ignore variables declared with
`using` or `await using` declarations, even if they are unused.

This is useful when working with resources that need to be disposed
via the explicit resource management proposal, where the primary
purpose is the disposal side effect rather than using the resource.

#### Example

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "ignoreUsingDeclarations": true }` option:

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "ignoreUsingDeclarations": true }]*/

using resource = getResource();
await using anotherResource = getAnotherResource();
```

### reportUsedIgnorePattern

type: `boolean`

The `reportUsedIgnorePattern` option is a boolean (default: `false`).
Using this option will report variables that match any of the valid
ignore pattern options (`varsIgnorePattern`, `argsIgnorePattern`,
`caughtErrorsIgnorePattern`, or `destructuredArrayIgnorePattern`) if
they have been used.

#### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for the `{ "reportUsedIgnorePattern": true }` option:

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "reportUsedIgnorePattern": true, "varsIgnorePattern": "[iI]gnored" }]*/

var firstVarIgnored = 1;
var secondVar = 2;
console.log(firstVarIgnored, secondVar);
```

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "reportUsedIgnorePattern": true }` option:

```javascript
/*eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "reportUsedIgnorePattern": true, "varsIgnorePattern": "[iI]gnored" }]*/

var firstVar = 1;
var secondVar = 2;
console.log(firstVar, secondVar);
```

### reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes

type: `boolean`

The `reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes` option is a boolean (default: `false`).

If `true`, the rule will also report variables that are only used as types.

#### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for the `{ "reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes": true }` option:

```javascript
/* eslint no-unused-vars: ["error", { "reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes": true }] */

const myNumber: number = 4;
export type MyNumber = typeof myNumber
```

Examples of **correct** code for the `{ "reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes": true }` option:

```javascript
export type MyNumber = number;
```

Note: even with `{ "reportVarsOnlyUsedAsTypes": false }`, cases where the value is
only used a type within itself will still be reported:

```javascript
function foo(): typeof foo {}
```

### vars

Controls how usage of a variable in the global scope is checked.

This option has two settings:

1. `all` checks all variables for usage, including those in the global
   scope. This is the default setting.
2. `local` checks only that locally-declared variables are used but will
   allow global variables to be unused.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-unused-vars
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error"
  }
}
```
