### What it does

ECMAScript 6 allows programmers to create variables with block scope
instead of function scope using the `let` and `const` keywords. Block
scope is common in many other programming languages and helps
programmers avoid mistakes.

### Why is this bad?

Using `var` in an es6 environment triggers this error

### Example

```javascript
// error
var x = "y";
var CONFIG = {};

// success
let x = "y";
const CONFIG = {};
```
