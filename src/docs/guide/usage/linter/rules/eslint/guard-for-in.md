# eslint/guard-for-in <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule is aimed at preventing unexpected behavior that could arise from using a for in loop without filtering the results in the loop. As such, it will warn when for in loops do not filter their results with an if statement.

### Why is this bad?

### Example

```javascript
for (key in foo) {
  doSomething(key);
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny guard-for-in
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "guard-for-in": "error"
  }
}
```
