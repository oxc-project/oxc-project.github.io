### What it does

This rule is aimed at preventing unexpected behavior that could arise from using a for in loop without filtering the results in the loop. As such, it will warn when for in loops do not filter their results with an if statement.

### Why is this bad?

### Example

```javascript
for (key in foo) {
  doSomething(key);
}
```
