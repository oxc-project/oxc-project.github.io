# eslint/getter-return

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does
Requires all getters to have a return statement

### Why is this bad?
Getters should always return a value. If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

### Example
```javascript
class Person{
    get name(){
        // no return
    }
}
```
