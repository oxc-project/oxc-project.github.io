# eslint/getter-return <Badge type="info" text="Nursery" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Requires all getters to have a `return` statement.

### Why is this bad?

Getters should always return a value. If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

This rule does not run on TypeScript files, since type checking will
catch getters that do not return a value.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
class Person {
  get name() {
    // no return
  }
}

const obj = {
  get foo() {
    // object getter are also checked
  },
};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
class Person {
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
}
```
