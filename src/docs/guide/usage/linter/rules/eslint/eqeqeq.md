# eslint/eqeqeq <Badge type="info" text="Pedantic" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="fix" type="info">
<span class="emoji">üõ†Ô∏è</span> An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Requires the use of the === and !== operators

### Why is this bad?

Using non-strict equality operators leads to hard to track bugs due to type coercion.

### Example

```javascript
let a = [];
let b = false;
a == b;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny eqeqeq
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "eqeqeq": "error"
  }
}
```
