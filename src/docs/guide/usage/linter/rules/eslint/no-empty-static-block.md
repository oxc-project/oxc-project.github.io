### What it does

Disallows the usages of empty static blocks

### Why is this bad?

Empty block statements, while not technically errors, usually occur due
to refactoring that wasn’t completed. They can cause confusion when
reading code.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
class Foo {
  static {}
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
class Foo {
  static {
    // blocks with comments are allowed
  }
}
class Bar {
  static {
    doSomething();
  }
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-empty-static-block": "error"
  }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-empty-static-block
```
