# eslint/no-this-before-super <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Requires calling `super()` before using `this` or `super`.

### Why is this bad?

Getters should always return a value.
If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

### Example

```javascript
class A1 extends B {
  constructor() {
    // super() needs to be called first
    this.a = 0;
    super();
  }
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-this-before-super
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-this-before-super": "error"
  }
}
```
