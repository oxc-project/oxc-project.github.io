### What it does

Disallows checking against NaN without using isNaN() call.

### Why is this bad?

In JavaScript, NaN is a special value of the Number type.
It’s used to represent any of the “not-a-number” values represented
by the double-precision 64-bit format as specified by the IEEE Standard
for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

Because NaN is unique in JavaScript by not being equal to anything, including itself,
the results of comparisons to NaN are confusing:

- NaN === NaN or NaN == NaN evaluate to false
- NaN !== NaN or NaN != NaN evaluate to true

Therefore, use Number.isNaN() or global isNaN() functions to test whether a value is NaN.

### Example

```javascript
foo == NaN;
foo === NaN;
foo <= NaN;
foo > NaN;
```
