### What it does

This rule disallows unused expressions.

### Why is this bad?

Unused expressions are usually a mistake. They can be a symptom of a bug or a misunderstanding of the code.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
Set<number>;
1 as number;
window!;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
const foo = new Set<number>();
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny no-unused-expressions
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-expressions": "error"
  }
}
```
