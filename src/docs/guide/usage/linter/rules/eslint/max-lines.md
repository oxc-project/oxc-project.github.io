### What it does

Enforce a maximum number of lines per file.

### Why is this bad?

Some people consider large files a code smell. Large files tend to do a
lot of things and can make it hard following what’s going. While there
is not an objective maximum number of lines considered acceptable in a
file, most people would agree it should not be in the thousands.
Recommendations usually range from 100 to 500 lines.

## Configuration

This rule accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

### max

type: `integer`

default: `300`

Maximum number of lines allowed per file.

### skipBlankLines

type: `boolean`

default: `false`

Whether to ignore blank lines when counting.

### skipComments

type: `boolean`

default: `false`

Whether to ignore comments when counting.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny max-lines
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "max-lines": "error"
  }
}
```
