### What it does

Disallows assignment operators in return statements

### Why is this bad?

Assignment is allowed by js in return expressions, but usually, an expression with only one equal sign is intended to be a comparison.
However, because of the missing equal sign, this turns to assignment, which is valid js code
Because of this ambiguity, it’s considered a best practice to not use assignment in return statements.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
() => (a = b);
function x() {
  return (a = b);
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
() => (a = b);
function x() {
  var result = (a = b);
  return result;
}
```
