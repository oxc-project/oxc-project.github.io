<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Checks that `@access` tags use one of the following values:

- "package", "private", "protected", "public"

Also reports:

- Mixing of `@access` with `@public`, `@private`, `@protected`, or `@package` on the same doc block.
- Use of multiple instances of `@access` (or the `@public`, etc) on the same doc block.

### Why is this bad?

It is important to have a consistent way of specifying access levels.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
/** @access private @public */

/** @access invalidlevel */
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
/** @access private */

/** @private */
```
