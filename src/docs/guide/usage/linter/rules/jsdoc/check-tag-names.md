### What it does

Reports invalid block tag names.
Additionally checks for tag names that are redundant when using a type checker such as TypeScript.

### Why is this bad?

Using invalid tags can lead to confusion and make the documentation harder to read.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
/** @Param */
/** @foo */

/**
 * This is redundant when typed.
 * @type {string}
 */
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
/** @param */
```
