# import/no-cycle

### What it does

Ensures that there is no resolvable path back to this module via its dependencies.

This includes cycles of depth 1 (imported module imports me) to "∞" (or Infinity),
if the maxDepth option is not set.

### Why is this bad?

Dependency cycles lead to confusing architectures where bugs become hard to find.

It is common to import an `undefined` value that is caused by a cyclic dependency.

### Example
```javascript
// dep-b.js
import './dep-a.js'
export function b() { /* ... */ }
```

```javascript
// dep-a.js
import { b } from './dep-b.js' // reported: Dependency cycle detected.
```
