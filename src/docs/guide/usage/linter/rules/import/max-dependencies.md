# import/max-dependencies

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Forbid modules to have too many dependencies (import or require statements).

### Why is this bad?

This is a useful rule because a module with too many dependencies is a code smell, and
usually indicates the module is doing too much and/or should be broken up into smaller
modules.

### Example

Given `{"max": 2}`
```javascript
import a from './a';
import b from './b';
import c from './c';
```
