# import/namespace

### What it does

Enforces names exist at the time they are dereferenced, when imported as a full namespace (i.e. import \* as foo from './foo'; foo.bar(); will report if bar is not exported by ./foo.).
Will report at the import declaration if there are no exported names found.
Also, will report for computed references (i.e. foo["bar"]()).
Reports on assignment to a member of an imported namespace.
