### What it does

Reports when named exports are not grouped together in a single export declaration
or when multiple assignments to CommonJS module.exports
or exports object are present in a single file.

### Why is this bad?

An export declaration or module.exports assignment can appear anywhere in the code.
By requiring a single export declaration all your exports will remain at one place,
making it easier to see what exports a module provides.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
export const first = true
export const second = true
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
const first = true
const second = true
export {
    first,
    second
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
    "plugins": ["import"],
    "rules": {
        "import/group-exports": "error"
    }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny import/group-exports --import-plugin
```
