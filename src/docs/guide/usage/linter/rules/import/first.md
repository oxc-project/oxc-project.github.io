### What it does

Forbids any non-import statements before imports except directives.

### Why is this bad?

Notably, imports are hoisted, which means the imported modules will be evaluated
before any of the statements interspersed between them.
Keeping all imports together at the top of the file may prevent surprises
resulting from this part of the spec
