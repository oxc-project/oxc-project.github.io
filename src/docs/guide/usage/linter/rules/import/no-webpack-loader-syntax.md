# import/no-webpack-loader-syntax

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Forbid Webpack loader syntax in imports.

### Why is this bad?

This loader syntax is non-standard, so it couples the code to Webpack. The recommended way to
specify Webpack loader configuration is in a [Webpack configuration file](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#configuration).

### Example

```javascript
import myModule from "my-loader!my-module";
import theme from "style!css!./theme.css";

var myModule = require("my-loader!./my-module");
var theme = require("style!css!./theme.css");
```
