# nextjs/no-page-custom-font <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Prevent page-only custom fonts.

### Why is this bad?

- The custom font you're adding was added to a page - this only adds the font to the specific page and not the entire application.
- The custom font you're adding was added to a separate component within pages/_document.js - this disables automatic font optimization.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny nextjs/no-page-custom-font --nextjs-plugin
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["nextjs"],
  "rules": {
    "nextjs/no-page-custom-font": "error"
  }
}
```
