### What it does

Enforce the use of as const over literal type.

### Why is this bad?

There are two common ways to tell TypeScript that a literal value should be interpreted as its literal type (e.g. 2) rather than general primitive type (e.g. number);

as const: telling TypeScript to infer the literal type automatically
as with the literal type: explicitly telling the literal type to TypeScript

as const is generally preferred, as it doesn't require re-typing the literal value.
This rule reports when an as with an explicit literal type can be replaced with an as const.

### Example

```ts
let bar: 2 = 2;
let foo = { bar: "baz" as "baz" };
```
