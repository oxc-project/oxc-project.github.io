### What it does

Require each enum member value to be explicitly initialized.

### Why is this bad?

In projects where the value of `enum` members are important, allowing implicit values for enums can cause bugs if enums are modified over time.

### Example

```typescript
// wrong, the value of `Close` is not constant
enum Status {
  Open = 1,
  Close,
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/prefer-enum-initializers
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/prefer-enum-initializers": "error"
  }
}
```
