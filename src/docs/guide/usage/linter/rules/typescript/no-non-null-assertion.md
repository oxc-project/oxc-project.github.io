# typescript/no-non-null-assertion <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions using the ! postfix operator.

### Why is this bad?

TypeScript's ! non-null assertion operator asserts to the type system that an expression is non-nullable, as in not null or undefined. Using assertions to tell the type system new information is often a sign that code is not fully type-safe. It's generally better to structure program logic so that TypeScript understands when values may be nullable.

### Example

```ts
x!;
x!.y;
x.y!;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-non-null-assertion
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-non-null-assertion": "error"
  }
}
```
