# typescript/no-misused-new <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.

</div>

### What it does

Enforce valid definition of `new` and `constructor`

### Why is this bad?

JavaScript classes may define a constructor method that runs
when a class instance is newly created.

TypeScript allows interfaces that describe a static class object to
define a `new()` method (though this is rarely used in real world code).
Developers new to JavaScript classes and/or TypeScript interfaces may
sometimes confuse when to use constructor or new.

### Example

```typescript
declare class C {
  new(): C;
}

interface I {
  new (): I;
  constructor(): void;
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-misused-new
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-misused-new": "error"
  }
}
```
