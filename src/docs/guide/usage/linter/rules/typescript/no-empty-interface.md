# typescript/no-empty-interface <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow the declaration of empty interfaces.

### Why is this bad?

An empty interface in TypeScript does very little: any non-nullable value is assignable to {}.
Using an empty interface is often a sign of programmer error, such as misunderstanding the concept of {} or forgetting to fill in fields.
This rule aims to ensure that only meaningful interfaces are declared in the code.

### Example

```ts
interface Foo {}
interface Bar extends Foo {}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-empty-interface
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-empty-interface": "error"
  }
}
```
