### What it does

This rule bans specific types and can suggest alternatives. Note that it does not ban the corresponding runtime objects from being used.

### Why is this bad?

Some built-in types have aliases, while some types are considered dangerous or harmful. It's often a good idea to ban certain types to help with consistency and safety.

### Example

```typescript
let foo: String = "foo";

let bar: Boolean = true;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/ban-types
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/ban-types": "error"
  }
}
```
