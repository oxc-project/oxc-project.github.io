### What it does

Enforce type definitions to consistently use either interface or type.

### Why is this bad?

TypeScript provides two common ways to define an object type: interface and type.
The two are generally very similar, and can often be used interchangeably.
Using the same type declaration style consistently helps with code readability.

### Example

```ts
// incorrect, when set to "interface"
type T = { x: number };

// incorrect when set to "type"
interface T {
  x: number;
}
```
