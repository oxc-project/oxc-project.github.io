# typescript/consistent-type-definitions <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

### What it does

Enforce type definitions to consistently use either interface or type.

### Why is this bad?

TypeScript provides two common ways to define an object type: interface and type.
The two are generally very similar, and can often be used interchangeably.
Using the same type declaration style consistently helps with code readability.

### Example

```ts
// incorrect, when set to "interface"
type T = { x: number };

// incorrect when set to "type"
interface T {
  x: number;
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/consistent-type-definitions
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/consistent-type-definitions": "error"
  }
}
```
