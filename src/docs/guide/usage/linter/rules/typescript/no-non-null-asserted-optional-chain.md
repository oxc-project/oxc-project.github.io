### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions after an optional chain expression.

### Why is this bad?

By design, optional chain expressions (`?.`) provide `undefined` as the expression's value, if the object being
accessed is `null` or `undefined`, instead of throwing an error. Using a non-null assertion (`!`) to assert the
result of an optional chain expression is contradictory and likely wrong, as it indicates the code is both expecting
the value to be potentially `null` or `undefined` and non-null at the same time.

In most cases, either:

1. The object is not nullable and did not need the `?.` for its property lookup
2. The non-null assertion is incorrect and introduces a type safety hole.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
foo?.bar!;
foo?.bar()!;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
foo?.bar;
foo.bar!;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain": "error"
  }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain
```
