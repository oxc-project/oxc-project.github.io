### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions after an optional chain expression.

### Why is this bad?

`?.` optional chain expressions provide undefined if an object is null or undefined.
Using a `!` non-null assertion to assert the result of an `?.` optional chain expression is non-nullable is likely wrong.

Most of the time, either the object was not nullable and did not need the `?.` for its property lookup, or the `!` is incorrect and introducing a type safety hole.

### Example

```ts
foo?.bar!;
foo?.bar()!;
```
