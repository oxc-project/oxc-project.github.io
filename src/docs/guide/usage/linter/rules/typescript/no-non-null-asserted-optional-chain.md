# typescript/no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions after an optional chain expression.

### Why is this bad?

`?.` optional chain expressions provide undefined if an object is null or undefined.
Using a `!` non-null assertion to assert the result of an `?.` optional chain expression is non-nullable is likely wrong.

Most of the time, either the object was not nullable and did not need the `?.` for its property lookup, or the `!` is incorrect and introducing a type safety hole.

### Example

```ts
foo?.bar!;
foo?.bar()!;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain": "error"
  }
}
```
