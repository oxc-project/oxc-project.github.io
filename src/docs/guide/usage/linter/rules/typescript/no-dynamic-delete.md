# typescript/no-dynamic-delete

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does
Disallow using the delete operator on computed key expressions.

### Why is this bad?
Deleting dynamically computed keys can be dangerous and in some cases not well optimized.
Using the delete operator on keys that aren't runtime constants could be a sign that you're using the wrong data structures.
Consider using a Map or Set if you’re using an object as a key-value collection.

### Example
```javascript
const container: { [i: string]: 0 } = {};
delete container['aa' + 'b'];
```
