### What it does

Disallow empty exports that don't change anything in a module file.

## Why is this bad?

An empty `export {}` statement is sometimes useful in TypeScript code to
turn a file that would otherwise be a script file into a module file.
Per the [TypeScript Handbook Modules page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/introduction.html):

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a
top-level import or export is considered a module. Conversely, a file
without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a
script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore
to modules as well).

However, an `export {}` statement does nothing if there are any other
top-level import or export statements in a file.

This rule reports an `export {}` that doesn't do anything in a file
already using ES modules.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
export const value = "Hello, world!";
export {};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
export const value = "Hello, world!";
```
