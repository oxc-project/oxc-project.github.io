### What it does

Disallow empty exports that don't change anything in a module file.

### Why is this bad?

An empty `export {}` statement is sometimes useful in TypeScript code to
turn a file that would otherwise be a script file into a module file.
Per the [TypeScript Handbook Modules page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/introduction.html):

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a
top-level import or export is considered a module. Conversely, a file
without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a
script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore
to modules as well).

However, an `export {}` statement does nothing if there are any other
top-level import or export statements in a file.

This rule reports an `export {}` that doesn't do anything in a file
already using ES modules.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
export const value = 'Hello, world!';
export {};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
export const value = 'Hello, world!';
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
    "rules": {
        "typescript/no-useless-empty-export": "error"
    }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-useless-empty-export
```
