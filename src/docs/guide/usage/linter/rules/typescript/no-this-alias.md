### What it does

Disallow unnecessary constraints on generic types.

### Why is this bad?

Generic type parameters (`<T>`) in TypeScript may be "constrained" with
an extends keyword. When no extends is provided, type parameters
default a constraint to unknown. It is therefore redundant to extend
from any or unknown.

the rule doesn't allow `const {allowedName} = this`
this is to keep 1:1 with eslint implementation
sampe with `obj.<allowedName> = this`

```
