### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator.

### Why is this bad?

The ?? nullish coalescing runtime operator allows providing a default value when dealing with null or undefined. Using a ! non-null assertion type operator in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator is redundant, and likely a sign of programmer error or confusion over the two operators.

### Example

```ts
foo! ?? bar;

let x: string;
x! ?? "";
```
