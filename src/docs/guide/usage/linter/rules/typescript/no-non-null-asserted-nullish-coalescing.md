# typescript/no-non-null-asserted-nullish-coalescing <Badge type="info" text="Restriction" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow non-null assertions in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator.

### Why is this bad?

The ?? nullish coalescing runtime operator allows providing a default value when dealing with null or undefined. Using a ! non-null assertion type operator in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator is redundant, and likely a sign of programmer error or confusion over the two operators.

### Example

```ts
foo! ?? bar;

let x: string;
x! ?? "";
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-non-null-asserted-nullish-coalescing
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-non-null-asserted-nullish-coalescing": "error"
  }
}
```
