### What it does

Enforce using @ts-expect-error over @ts-ignore.

### Why is this bad?

TypeScript allows you to suppress all errors on a line by placing a comment starting with @ts-ignore or @ts-expect-error immediately before the erroring line.
The two directives work the same, except @ts-expect-error causes a type error if placed before a line that's not erroring in the first place.

This means it's easy for @ts-ignores to be forgotten about, and remain in code even after the error they were suppressing is fixed.
This is dangerous, as if a new error arises on that line it'll be suppressed by the forgotten about @ts-ignore, and so be missed.

### Example

```javascript
// @ts-ignore
const str: string = 1;

/**
* Explaining comment
*
* @ts-ignore */
const multiLine: number = 'value';
```
