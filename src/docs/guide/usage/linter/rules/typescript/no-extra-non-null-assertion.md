# typescript/no-extra-non-null-assertion <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow extra non-null assertions.

### Why is this bad?

The `!` non-null assertion operator in TypeScript is used to assert that a value's type does not include null or undefined. Using the operator any more than once on a single value does nothing.

### Example

```ts
const foo: { bar: number } | null = null;
const bar = foo!!!.bar;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny typescript/no-extra-non-null-assertion
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript/no-extra-non-null-assertion": "error"
  }
}
```
