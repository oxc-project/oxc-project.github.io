### What it does

Disallow extra non-null assertions.

### Why is this bad?

The `!` non-null assertion operator in TypeScript is used to assert that a value's type does not include null or undefined. Using the operator any more than once on a single value does nothing.

### Example

```ts
const foo: { bar: number } | null = null;
const bar = foo!!!.bar;
```
