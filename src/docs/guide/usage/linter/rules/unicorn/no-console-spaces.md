# unicorn/no-console-spaces

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
🛠️ An auto-fix is available for this rule.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallows leading/trailing space inside `console.log()` and similar methods.

### Why is this bad?

The `console.log()` method and similar methods join the parameters with a space so adding a leading/trailing space to a parameter, results in two spaces being added.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
console.log("abc ", "def");

// Good
console.log("abc", "def");
```
