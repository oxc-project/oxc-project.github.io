### What it does

Disallows returning values wrapped in `Promise.resolve` or `Promise.reject` in an async function or a `Promise#then`/`catch`/`finally` callback.

### Why is this bad?

Wrapping a return value in `Promise.resolve` in an async function or a `Promise#then`/`catch`/`finally` callback is unnecessary as all return values in async functions and promise callback functions are already wrapped in a `Promise`. Similarly, returning an error wrapped in `Promise.reject` is equivalent to simply `throw`ing the error. This is the same for `yield`ing in async generators as well.

### Example
```javascript
// bad
async () => Promise.resolve(bar);

// good
async () => bar;
```
