# unicorn/prefer-dom-node-text-content <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<Alert class="fix" type="info">
<span class="emoji">🛠️</span> An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.

### What it does

Enforces the use of `.textContent` over `.innerText` for DOM nodes.

### Why is this bad?

There are some disadvantages of using .innerText.

- `.innerText` is much more performance-heavy as it requires layout information to return the result.
- `.innerText` is defined only for HTMLElement objects, while `.textContent` is defined for all Node objects.
- `.innerText` is not standard, for example, it is not present in Firefox.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
const text = foo.innerText;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
const text = foo.textContent;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny unicorn/prefer-dom-node-text-content
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "unicorn/prefer-dom-node-text-content": "error"
  }
}
```
