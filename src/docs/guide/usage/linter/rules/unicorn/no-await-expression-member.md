# unicorn/no-await-expression-member

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule disallows member access from await expression

### Why is this bad?

When accessing a member from an await expression,
the await expression has to be parenthesized, which is not readable.

### Example

```javascript
async function bad() {
  const secondElement = (await getArray())[1];
}

async function good() {
  const [, secondElement] = await getArray();
}
```
