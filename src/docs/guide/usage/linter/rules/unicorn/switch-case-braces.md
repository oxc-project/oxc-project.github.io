### What it does

Require empty switch cases to not have braces. Non-empty braces are required to have braces around them.

### Why is this bad?

There is less visual clutter for empty cases and proper scope for non-empty cases.

### Example

```javascript
switch (num) {
  case 1: {
  }
  case 2:
    console.log("Case 2");
    break;
}
```
