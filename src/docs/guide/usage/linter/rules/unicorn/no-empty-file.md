<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does


Disallows any files only containing the following:
 - Whitespace
 - Comments
 - Directives
 - Empty statements
 - Empty blocks
 - Hashbang

### Why is this bad?

Meaningless files clutter a codebase.
