### What it does

When spreading a ternary in an array, we can use both [] and '' as fallbacks,
but it's better to have consistent types in both branches.

### Why is this bad?

Having consistent types in both branches makes the code easier to read and understand.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
const array = [
  a,
  ...(foo ? [b, c] : ""),
];

const array = [
  a,
  ...(foo ? "bc" : []),
];
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
const array = [
  a,
  ...(foo ? [b, c] : []),
];

const array = [
  a,
  ...(foo ? "bc" : ""),
];
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "unicorn/consistent-empty-array-spread": "error"
  }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny unicorn/consistent-empty-array-spread
```
