# unicorn/no-thenable <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

disallow `then` property

### Why is this bad?

If an object is defined as "thenable", once it's accidentally
used in an await expression, it may cause problems:

### Example

```javascript
async function example() {
  const foo = {
    unicorn: 1,
    then() {},
  };

  const { unicorn } = await foo;

  console.log("after"); //<- This will never execute
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny unicorn/no-thenable
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "unicorn/no-thenable": "error"
  }
}
```
