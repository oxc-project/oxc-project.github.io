<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow unreadable array destructuring

### Why is this bad?

Destructuring is very useful, but it can also make some code harder to read.
This rule prevents ignoring consecutive values when destructuring from an array.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
const [, , foo] = parts;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
const [foo] = parts;
```
