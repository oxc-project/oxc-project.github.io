# unicorn/error-message

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule enforces a `message` value to be passed in when creating an instance of a built-in `Error` object, which leads to more readable and debuggable code.

### Example

```javascript
// Fail
throw Error();
throw new TypeError();

// Pass
throw new Error("Unexpected token");
throw new TypeError("Number expected");
```
