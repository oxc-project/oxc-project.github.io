### What it does

Disallow the use of the `null` literal, to encourage using `undefined` instead.

### Why is this bad?

There are some reasons for using `undefined` instead of `null`.

- From experience, most developers use `null` and `undefined` inconsistently and interchangeably, and few know when to use which.
- Supporting both `null` and `undefined` complicates input validation.
- Using `null` makes TypeScript types more verbose: `type A = {foo?: string | null}` vs `type A = {foo?: string}`.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
let foo = null;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
let foo;
```
