# jsx_a11y/heading-has-content <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Enforce that heading elements (h1, h2, etc.) have content and
that the content is accessible to screen readers.
Accessible means that it is not hidden using the aria-hidden prop.

### Why is this bad?

Screen readers alert users to the presence of a heading tag.
If the heading is empty or the text cannot be accessed,
this could either confuse users or even prevent them
from accessing information on the page's structure.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<h1 />
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<h1>Foo</h1>
```
