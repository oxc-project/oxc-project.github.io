# jsx_a11y/label-has-associated-control <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">✅</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Enforce that a label tag has a text label and an associated control.

### Why is this bad?

A form label that either isn't properly associated with a form control (such as an `<input>`), or doesn't contain accessible text, hinders accessibility for users using assistive technologies such as screen readers. The user may not have enough information to understand the purpose of the form control.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
    return <label {...props} />
}

<input type="text" />
<label>Surname</label>
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
function Foo(props) {
  const { htmlFor, ...otherProps } = props;

  return <label htmlFor={htmlFor} {...otherProps} />;
}

<label>
  <input type="text" />
  Surname
</label>;
```
