### What it does

Checks for redundant comparisons between constants:

- Checks for ineffective double comparisons against constants.
- Checks for impossible comparisons against constants.

### Why is this bad?

Only one of the comparisons has any effect on the result, the programmer probably intended to flip one of the comparison operators, or compare a different value entirely.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
status_code <= 400 && status_code > 500;
status_code < 200 && status_code <= 299;
status_code > 500 && status_code >= 500;

// Good
status_code >= 400 && status_code < 500;
500 <= status_code && 600 > status_code;
500 <= status_code && status_code <= 600;
```
