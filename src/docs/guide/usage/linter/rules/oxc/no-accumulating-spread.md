# oxc/no-accumulating-spread

### What it does

Prevents using object or array spreads on accumulators in `Array.prototype.reduce()`.

### Why is this bad?

Object and array spreads create a new object or array on each iteration.
In the worst case, they also cause O(n) copies (both memory and time complexity).
When used on an accumulator, this can lead to `O(n^2)` memory complexity and
`O(n^2)` time complexity.

For a more in-depth explanation, see this [blog post](https://prateeksurana.me/blog/why-using-object-spread-with-reduce-bad-idea/)
by Prateek Surana.

### Example

Pass

```javascript
function fn(x) {
  // ...
}

arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc.push(fn(x)), []);
Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, el) => {
  acc[el] = fn(el);
}, {});
// spreading non-accumulators should be avoided if possible, but is not
// banned by this rule
Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, el) => {
  acc[el] = { ...obj[el] };
  return acc;
}, {});
```

Fail

```javascript
arr.reduce((acc, x) => ({ ...acc, [x]: fn(x) }), {});
Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, el) => ({ ...acc, [el]: fn(el) }), {});
```
