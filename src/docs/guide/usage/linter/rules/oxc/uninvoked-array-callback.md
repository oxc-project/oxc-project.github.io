# oxc/uninvoked-array-callback

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
This rule applies when an Array function has a callback argument used for an array with empty slots.

### Why is this bad?
When the Array constructor is called with a single number argument, an array with the specified number of empty slots (not actual undefined values) is constructed.
If a callback function is passed to the function of this array, the callback function is never invoked because the array has no actual elements.

### Example
```javascript
  const list = new Array(5).map(_ => createElement());
```
