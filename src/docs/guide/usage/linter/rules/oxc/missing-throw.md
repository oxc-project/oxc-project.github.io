### What it does

Checks whether the `throw` keyword is missing in front of a `new` expression.

### Why is this bad?

The `throw` keyword is required in front of a `new` expression to throw an error. Omitting it is usually a mistake.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```javascript
function foo() {
  throw Error();
}
const foo = () => {
  new Error();
};
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```javascript
function foo() {
  throw new Error();
}
const foo = () => {
  throw new Error();
};
```
