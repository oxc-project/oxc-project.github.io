# jest/no-mocks-import <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

This rule reports imports from a path containing a **mocks** component.

### Why is this bad?

Manually importing mocks from a `__mocks__` directory can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
import thing from "./__mocks__/index";
require("./__mocks__/index");
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
import thing from "thing";
require("thing");
```
