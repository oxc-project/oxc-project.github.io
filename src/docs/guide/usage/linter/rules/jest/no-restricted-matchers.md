<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Ban specific matchers & modifiers from being used, and can suggest alternatives.

### Example

```javascript

it('is false', () => {
  if this has a modifier (i.e. `not.toBeFalsy`), it would be considered fine
  expect(a).toBeFalsy();
});

it('resolves', async () => {
  // all uses of this modifier are disallowed, regardless of matcher
  await expect(myPromise()).resolves.toBe(true);
});

describe('when an error happens', () => {
  it('does not upload the file', async () => {
    // all uses of this matcher are disallowed
    expect(uploadFileMock).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith('file.name');
  });
});


```
