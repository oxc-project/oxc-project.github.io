🛠️ An auto-fix is available for this rule.

### What it does

When asserting against primitive literals such as numbers and strings, the
equality matchers all operate the same, but read slightly differently in code.

This rule recommends using the `toBe` matcher in these situations, as it forms
the most grammatically natural sentence. For `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` this
rule recommends using their specific `toBe` matchers, as they give better error
messages as well.

### Example

```javascript
// valid
expect(value).not.toBe(5);
expect(getMessage()).toBe("hello world");
expect(loadMessage()).resolves.toBe("hello world");
expect(didError).not.toBe(true);
expect(catchError()).toStrictEqual({ message: "oh noes!" });

// invalid
expect(value).not.toEqual(5);
expect(getMessage()).toStrictEqual("hello world");
expect(loadMessage()).resolves.toEqual("hello world");
```
