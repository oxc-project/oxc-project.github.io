### What it does

This rule reminds you to remove `.only` from your tests by raising a warning
whenever you are using the exclusivity feature.

### Why is this bad?

Jest has a feature that allows you to focus tests by appending `.only` or
prepending `f` to a test-suite or a test-case. This feature is really helpful to
debug a failing test, so you don‚Äôt have to execute all of your tests. After you
have fixed your test and before committing the changes you have to remove
`.only` to ensure all tests are executed on your build system.

### Example

```javascript
describe.only("foo", () => {});
it.only("foo", () => {});
describe["only"]("bar", () => {});
it["only"]("bar", () => {});
test.only("foo", () => {});
test["only"]("bar", () => {});
fdescribe("foo", () => {});
fit("foo", () => {});
fit.each`
  table
`();
```

This rule is compatible with [eslint-plugin-vitest](https://github.com/veritem/eslint-plugin-vitest/blob/v1.1.9/docs/rules/no-focused-tests.md),
to use it, add the following configuration to your `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vitest/no-focused-tests": "error"
  }
}
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny jest/no-focused-tests --jest-plugin
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["jest"],
  "rules": {
    "jest/no-focused-tests": "error"
  }
}
```
