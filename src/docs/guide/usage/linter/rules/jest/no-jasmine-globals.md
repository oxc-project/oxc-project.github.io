# jest/no-jasmine-globals

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="fix" type="info">
<span class="emoji">🛠️</span> An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

This rule reports on any usage of Jasmine globals, which is not ported to Jest, and suggests alternatives from Jest's own API.

### Example

```javascript
jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 5000;
test("my test", () => {
  pending();
});
test("my test", () => {
  jasmine.createSpy();
});
```
