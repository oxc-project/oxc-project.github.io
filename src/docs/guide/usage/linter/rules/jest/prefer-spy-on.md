### What it does

When mocking a function by overwriting a property you have to manually restore
the original implementation when cleaning up. When using `jest.spyOn()` Jest
keeps track of changes, and they can be restored with `jest.restoreAllMocks()`,
`mockFn.mockRestore()` or by setting `restoreMocks` to `true` in the Jest
config.

Note: The mock created by `jest.spyOn()` still behaves the same as the original
function. The original function can be overwritten with
`mockFn.mockImplementation()` or by some of the
[other mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api).

### Example

```javascript
// invalid
Date.now = jest.fn();
Date.now = jest.fn(() => 10);

// valid
jest.spyOn(Date, "now");
jest.spyOn(Date, "now").mockImplementation(() => 10);
```
