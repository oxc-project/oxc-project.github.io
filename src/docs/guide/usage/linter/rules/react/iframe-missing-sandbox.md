### What it does

Enforce sandbox attribute on iframe elements

### Why is this bad?

The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the
content in the iframe. Using sandbox attribute is considered a good
security practice. To learn more about sandboxing, see [MDN's documentation on the `sandbox` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox).

This rule checks all React `<iframe>` elements and verifies that there
is `sandbox` attribute and that it's value is valid. In addition to that
it also reports cases where attribute contains `allow-scripts` and
`allow-same-origin` at the same time as this combination allows the
embedded document to remove the sandbox attribute and bypass the
restrictions.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<iframe />;
<iframe sandbox="invalid-value" />;
<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" />;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<iframe sandbox="" />;
<iframe sandbox="allow-origin" />;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny react/iframe-missing-sandbox --react-plugin
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/iframe-missing-sandbox": "error"
  }
}
```
