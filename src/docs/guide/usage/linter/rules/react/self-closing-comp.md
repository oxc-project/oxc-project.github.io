### What it does

Detects components without children which can be self-closed to avoid
unnecessary extra closing tags.

### Why is this bad?

Components without children don't need explicit closing tags. Using
self-closing syntax makes code more concise and reduces visual clutter.
It also follows common React and JSX conventions for empty elements.

A self-closing component which contains whitespace is allowed except
when it also contains a newline.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
const elem = <Component linter="oxlint"></Component>;
const dom_elem = <div id="oxlint"></div>;
const welem = <div id="oxlint"></div>;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
const elem = <Component linter="oxlint" />;
const welem = <Component linter="oxlint"> </Component>;
const dom_elem = <div id="oxlint" />;
```

## Configuration

This rule accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

### component

type: `boolean`

default: `true`

Whether to enforce self-closing for custom components.

### html

type: `boolean`

default: `true`

Whether to enforce self-closing for native HTML elements.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule using the config file or in the CLI, you can use:

::: code-group

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/self-closing-comp": "error"
  }
}
```

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny react/self-closing-comp --react-plugin
```
