# react/jsx-no-useless-fragment <Badge type="info" text="Pedantic" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow unnecessary fragments.

### Why is this bad?

Fragments are a useful tool when you need to group multiple children without adding a node to the DOM tree. However, sometimes you might end up with a fragment with a single child. When this child is an element, string, or expression, it's not necessary to use a fragment.

### Example

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<>foo</>
<div><>foo</></div>
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<>foo <div></div></>
<div>foo</div>
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny react/jsx-no-useless-fragment
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-no-useless-fragment": "error"
  }
}
```
