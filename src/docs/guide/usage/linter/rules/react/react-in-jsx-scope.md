# react/react-in-jsx-scope

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow missing React when using JSX

### Why is this bad?

When using JSX, `<a />` expands to `React.createElement("a")`. Therefore the `React` variable must be in scope.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
var a = <a />;

// Good
import React from "react";
var a = <a />;
```
