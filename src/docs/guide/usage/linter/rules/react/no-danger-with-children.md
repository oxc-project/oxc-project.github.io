# react/no-danger-with-children <Badge type="info" text="Correctness" />

<div class="rule-meta">
<Alert class="default-on" type="success">
<span class="emoji">âœ…</span> This rule is turned on by default.
</Alert>
</div>

### What it does

Disallows when a DOM element is using both `children` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` properties.

### Why is this bad?

React will throw a warning if this rule is ignored and both `children` and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` are used.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "HTML" }}>Children</div>;
React.createElement(
  "div",
  { dangerouslySetInnerHTML: { __html: "HTML" } },
  "Children",
);
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<div>Children</div>
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "HTML" }} />
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny react/no-danger-with-children --react-plugin
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/no-danger-with-children": "error"
  }
}
```
