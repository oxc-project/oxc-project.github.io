### What it does

Disallow usage of `javascript:` URLs

### Why is this bad?

URLs starting with `javascript:` are a dangerous attack surface because it’s easy to accidentally include unsanitized output in a tag like `<a href>` and create a security hole.
In React 16.9 any URLs starting with `javascript:` scheme log a warning.
In a future major release, React will throw an error if it encounters a `javascript:` URL.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<a href="javascript:void(0)">Test</a>;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<Foo test="javascript:void(0)" />;
```

## Configuration

This rule accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

### components

type: `Record<string, array>`

default: `{}`

Additional components to check.

### includeFromSettings

type: `boolean`

default: `false`

Whether to include components from settings.

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny react/jsx-no-script-url --react-plugin
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-no-script-url": "error"
  }
}
```
