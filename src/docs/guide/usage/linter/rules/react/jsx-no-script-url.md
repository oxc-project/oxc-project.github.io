### What it does

Disallow usage of `javascript:` URLs

### Why is this bad?

URLs starting with `javascript:` are a dangerous attack surface because it’s easy to accidentally include unsanitized output in a tag like `<a href>` and create a security hole.
In React 16.9 any URLs starting with `javascript:` scheme log a warning.
In a future major release, React will throw an error if it encounters a `javascript:` URL.

### Examples

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```jsx
<a href="javascript:void(0)">Test</a>
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```jsx
<Foo test="javascript:void(0)" />
```
