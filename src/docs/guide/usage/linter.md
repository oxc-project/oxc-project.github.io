# Linter (oxlint)

<AppBadgeList />

Oxlint is designed to catch erroneous or useless code without requiring any configurations by default.

:::info
At the current stage, oxlint is **not intended to fully replace ESLint**; it serves as an enhancement when ESLint's slowness becomes a bottleneck in your workflow.

We recommend running oxlint before ESLint in your lint-staged or CI setup for a quicker feedback loop, considering it only takes a few seconds to run on large codebases.
:::

## Features

- 50 - 100 times faster than ESLint, and scales with the number of CPU cores ([benchmark](https://github.com/oxc-project/bench-javascript-linter)).
- Over 480 rules with a growing list from `eslint`, `typescript`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-jest`, `eslint-plugin-unicorn`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and [many more](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/481).
- Supports
  - [.eslintignore](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#the-eslintignore-file).
  - [ESLint comment disabling](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-rules).
  - [Partial ESLint v8 Configuration](./linter/config) in `json` format

## Language Support

- Supports:
  - JavaScript and TypeScript by their extensions `js`, `mjs`, `cjs`, `jsx`, `ts`, `mts`, `cts` and `tsx`.
  - `<script>` content of `.vue`, `.astro` and `.svelte` files.
- No support for:
  - [type-aware rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting) defined by `typescript-eslint`.
  - [stylistic rules](https://eslint.style).

## Installation

Run `oxlint` directly at the root of your repository:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npx oxlint@latest
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm dlx oxlint@latest
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn dlx oxlint@latest
```

```sh [bun]
$ bunx oxlint@latest
```

```sh [deno]
$ deno run npm:oxlint@latest
```

:::

Or save it to your package.json:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm add -D oxlint
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm add -D oxlint
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn add -D oxlint
```

```sh [bun]
$ bun add -D oxlint
```

:::

`oxlint` does not require Node.js, the binaries can be downloaded from the [latest GitHub releases](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/releases/latest).

## Command-line Interface

See [Command-line Interface](./linter/cli)

## Configuration File

See [Configuration File](./linter/config)

## Migrate from eslint flat config

If you have an existing `eslint.config.*` file, you can convert it to an `.oxlintrc.json` config with [oxlint-migrate](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxlint-migrate).
This script is still under development, please recheck the generated config file.

## Integration

### ESLint

If you are looking for a way to use oxlint in projects that still need ESLint, you can use [eslint-plugin-oxlint](https://github.com/oxc-project/eslint-plugin-oxlint) to turn off ESLint rules that are already supported by oxlint. So you can enjoy the speed of oxlint while still using ESLint.

### lint-staged

```json [package.json]
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{js,mjs,cjs,jsx,ts,mts,cts,tsx,vue,astro,svelte}": "oxlint"
  }
}
```

### VSCode Extension

Download the official VSCode extension from the

- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oxc.oxc-vscode)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/oxc/oxc-vscode)

### Zed Extension

### Continuous Integration

Since `oxlint` only takes a few seconds to run, we recommend running `oxlint` before ESLint for faster feedback loops.

#### GitHub Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  oxlint:
    name: Lint JS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx --yes oxlint@0.0.0 --deny-warnings # change to the latest release
```

It is advised to pin the version, otherwise CI may fail after a new release.

### pre-commit

```yaml [.pre-commit-hooks.yaml]
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/oxc-project/mirrors-oxlint
    rev: v0.0.0 # change to the latest version
    hooks:
      - id: oxlint
        verbose: true
