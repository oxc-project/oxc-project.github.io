# Formatter

Oxfmt (`/oh-eks-for-mat/`) is currently work in progress.

For configuration, you can create an `.oxfmtrc.json` file with the following schema: https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/main/npm/oxfmt/configuration_schema.json

You may use [@prettier/plugin-oxc](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/packages/plugin-oxc) in prettier to gain some parsing speed.
