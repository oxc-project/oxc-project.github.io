# Getting Started

## Overview

Oxc (each letter is individually pronounced, `/oh-eks-see/`) is the JavaScript Oxidation Compiler, a collection of high-performance tools for the JavaScript language written in Rust.

Our focus lies in constructing essential compiler tools for JavaScript: parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier and resolver.

Our goal is to empower the [next generation toolchain for JavaScript](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc) as part of [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev).

#### [Evan You](https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1734439543280128030), creator of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev):

> Ran oxlint on the Vue 3 codebase, ~200 rules + ~590 files finished in 50ms ðŸ¤¯ (30ms re-runs)
>
> The performance is absolutely nuts

#### [Jason Miller](https://github.com/developit), creator of [Preact](https://preactjs.com):

> oxlint has been a massive win for us at Shopify. Our previous linting setup took 75 minutes to run, so we were fanning it out across 40+ workers in CI.
>
> By comparison, oxlint takes around 10 seconds to lint the same codebase on a single worker, and the output is easier to interpret.
>
> We even caught a few bugs that were hidden or skipped by our old setup when we migrated!

#### [Luke Edwards](https://x.com/lukeed05/status/1829527267162345651)

> For a while now, @boshen_c has been crushing it, setting the foundation for the next generation of JS tooling.
>
> There's just so much to learn from the OXC source code. Everything is meticulously measured and benchmarked, then formalized into simple, elegant, non-frightening APIs.
>
> This guy is brilliant, a team player, and is + has been doing thankless, hard work.

#### [Yagiz Nizipli](https://github.com/sponsors/anonrig), founder of [Node.js performance team](https://github.com/nodejs/performance):

> I'm impressed by how oxc is actively encouraging JavaScript tools to improve their performance.

#### [Eric Simons](https://x.com/ericsimons40/status/1766525300584947999), CEO of [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/):

> Oxc is slept on rn
>
> Most JS/TS toolchains will be using it within the next few yrs imo

#### [Miles Johnson](https://x.com/mileswjohnson/status/1734698340791800283), creator of [Moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev):

> It's crazy how good oxlint (and oxc tools) is. Not just in performance, but ease of use. Banking on Rust was a good choice!

#### [Joe Savona](https://x.com/en_JS/status/1676467920334094336), [React](https://react.dev) team member:

> Forâ€¦reasons I am experimenting w various Rust-based JS compilers. I donâ€™t agree w every design decision but overall oxc is really well done.

> oxc is kinda neat
