# Configuration

Oxlint works out of the box, but most teams commit a configuration file to keep linting consistent across local runs, editors, and CI.

This page focuses on project configuration: rules, categories, plugins, overrides, and shared settings.

## Create a config file

To generate a starter config in the current directory:

```sh
oxlint --init
```

Oxlint automatically looks for a `.oxlintrc.json` in the current working directory. You can also pass a config explicitly:

```sh
oxlint -c ./oxlintrc.json
# or
oxlint --config ./oxlintrc.json
```

Notes:

* Only `.json` config files are supported, and configuration files support comments (JSONC).
* The configuration format aims to be compatible with ESLint v8 (`eslintrc.json`).

A minimal configuration looks like this:

```jsonc [.oxlintrc.json]
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "warn",
  },
  "rules": {
    "eslint/no-unused-vars": "error",
  },
}
```

## Configuration file format

A configuration file is a JSON object. The most common top-level fields are:

* `rules`: Enable or disable rules, set severity, and configure rule options.
* `categories`: Enable groups of rules with similar intent.
* `plugins`: Enable built-in plugins that provide additional rules.
* `jsPlugins`: Configure JavaScript plugins (experimental).
* `overrides`: Apply different configuration to different file patterns.
* `extends`: Inherit configuration from other files.
* `ignorePatterns`: Ignore additional files from the config file.
* `env`: Enable predefined globals for common environments.
* `globals`: Declare custom globals as read-only or writable.
* `settings`: Plugin-wide configuration shared by multiple rules.

For a complete list of fields, see the [Config file reference](/docs/guide/usage/linter/config-file-reference.html).

## Configure rules

Rules are configured under `rules`.

A rule value is either:

* a severity (`"off"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`), or
* an array of `[severity, options]`

If a rule name is unique, you can configure it without a plugin prefix. For example, `no-console` is the same as `eslint/no-console`.

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-alert": "error",
    "oxc/approx-constant": "warn",
    "no-plusplus": "off",
  },
}
```

### Severity values

Oxlint accepts ESLint-style severities:

* Allow rule: `"off"`, `0`, `"allow"`
* Warning on rule: `"warn"`, `1`
* Error on rule: `"error"`, `2`, `"deny"`

### Rule options

To configure rule options, use an array:

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-plusplus": ["error", { "allowForLoopAfterthoughts": true }],
  },
}
```

All available rules are listed in the [Rules reference](/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules).

### Override severity from the CLI

For quick experiments, you can adjust severity from the command line using:

* `-A` / `--allow`
* `-W` / `--warn`
* `-D` / `--deny`

Arguments are applied from left to right:

```sh
oxlint -D no-alert -W oxc/approx-constant -A no-plusplus
```

## Enable groups of rules with categories

Categories let you enable or disable sets of rules with similar intent. By default, Oxlint enables rules in the `correctness` category.

Configure categories using `categories`:

```jsonc
{
  "categories": {
    "correctness": "error",
    "suspicious": "warn",
    "pedantic": "off",
  },
}
```

Available categories include:

* `correctness`: Code that is definitely wrong or useless
* `suspicious`: Code that is likely to be wrong or useless
* `pedantic`: Extra strict rules that may have false positives
* `perf`: Rules that aim to improve runtime performance
* `style`: Idiomatic and consistent style rules
* `restriction`: Rules that ban specific patterns or features
* `nursery`: Rules under development that may change

You can also change categories from the CLI with the same `-A`, `-W`, and `-D` options:

```sh
oxlint -D correctness -D suspicious
```

## Configure plugins

Plugins extend the set of available rules.

Oxlint supports many popular plugins natively in Rust. This provides broad rule coverage without a large JavaScript dependency tree. See [Native Plugins](/docs/guide/usage/linter/plugins).

Configure plugins using `plugins`. Setting `plugins` overwrites the default plugin set, so the array should include everything you want enabled:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": ["unicorn", "typescript", "oxc"],
}
```

To disable all default plugins:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [],
}
```

For plugin details and CLI flags such as `--import-plugin`, see [Native Plugins](/docs/guide/usage/linter/plugins).

## Configure JS plugins (experimental)

Oxlint also supports JavaScript plugins via `jsPlugins`. This is intended for compatibility and advanced integrations.

Notes:

* JS plugins are experimental and not subject to semver.
* JS plugins are not supported in the language server at present.

JS plugins can be declared as strings or as objects with an alias:

```jsonc
{
  "jsPlugins": [{ "name": "my-eslint-react", "specifier": "eslint-plugin-react" }],
}
```

Some plugin names are reserved because they are implemented natively in Rust (for example `react`, `unicorn`, `typescript`, `oxc`, `import`, `jest`, `vitest`, `jsx-a11y`, `nextjs`). If you need the JavaScript version of a reserved plugin, give it a custom `name` to avoid conflicts.

For details, see [JS plugins](/docs/guide/usage/linter/js-plugins).

## Apply configuration by file pattern

Use `overrides` to apply different configuration to different files, such as tests, scripts, or TypeScript-only paths.

`overrides` is an array of objects. Each override can include:

* `files`: glob patterns
* `rules`: rule configuration (same shape as top-level `rules`)
* `env`: environment configuration (same shape as top-level `env`)
* `globals`: globals configuration (same shape as top-level `globals`)
* `plugins`: optionally change what plugins are enabled for this override
* `jsPlugins`: JS plugins for this override (experimental)

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "error",
  },
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["scripts/*.js"],
      "rules": {
        "no-console": "off",
      },
    },
    {
      "files": ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
      "plugins": ["typescript"],
      "rules": {
        "typescript/no-explicit-any": "error",
      },
    },
    {
      "files": ["**/test/**"],
      "plugins": ["jest"],
      "env": {
        "jest": true,
      },
      "rules": {
        "jest/no-disabled-tests": "off",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Extend shared configs

Use `extends` to inherit from other configuration files.

Paths in `extends` are resolved relative to the configuration file that declares `extends`. Configs are merged from first to last, with later entries overriding earlier ones.

```jsonc
{
  "extends": ["./configs/base.json", "./configs/frontend.json"],
}
```

## Configure environments and globals

Use `env` to enable predefined globals for common environments such as browser or node.

Use `globals` to declare project-specific globals, mark them writable or readonly, or disable a global that would otherwise be present.

```jsonc
{
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
  },
  "globals": {
    "MY_GLOBAL": "readonly",
    "Promise": "off",
  },
}
```

`globals` accepts:

* `"readonly"` or `"readable"` or `false`
* `"writable"` or `"writeable"` or `true`
* `"off"` to disable a global

## Plugin settings

Use `settings` for plugin-wide configuration shared by multiple rules.

Example (monorepo + React + jsx-a11y):

```jsonc
{
  "settings": {
    "next": {
      "rootDir": "apps/dashboard/",
    },
    "react": {
      "linkComponents": [{ "name": "Link", "linkAttribute": "to" }],
    },
    "jsx-a11y": {
      "components": {
        "Link": "a",
        "Button": "button",
      },
    },
  },
}
```
